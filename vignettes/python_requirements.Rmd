## Introducing 'uv'

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package manager written in 
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  Important features that relate to `reticulate` 
are:

- Creates and manages Python virtual environments

- Installs Python packages much faster than other alternatives

- Installs and manages Python versions

- It's cross-platform, meaning it works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. 

- Installation is very light, and essentially dependency free. 


Starting with version 1.41, `reticulate` will to use **uv** as the default
Python virtual environment manager. When you start interacting with Python, 
`reticulate` will "ask" **uv** for a virtual environment for you to use.  
The main goal is for you as an user, especially if a new user, is to start using 
Python easily and painlessly.  


## 'uv' binary order of discovery

In order, `reticulate` will look for an **uv** installation path in the following
order:

1. `RETICULATE_UV` environment variable

2. `reticulate.uv_binary` option

3. System level path for 'uv' (`Sys.which("uv")`)As

4. Default location where 'uv' installs its binary (*'~/.local/bin/uv'*)

5. *'r-reticulate/bin'* sub-folder inside your user's cache directory 
(`rappdirs::user_cache_dir()`)

If no path is found, then `reticulate` will attempt to download and install 
**uv** in the a sub-folder inside your user's cache directory (No. 5). 
`reticulate` will install **uv** in such a way that it will not change any
system level path values in your computer.
