\title{Create a Python function that will always be called on the main thread}
\usage{
py_main_thread_func(f)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{An R function with arbitrary arguments}
}
\value{
A Python function that delegates to the passed R function, which
is guaranteed to always be called on the main thread.
}
\description{
This function is helpful when you need to provide a callback to a Python
library which may invoke the callback on a background thread. As R functions
must run on the main thread, wrapping the R function with \code{py_main_thread_func()}
will ensure that R code is only executed on the main thread.
