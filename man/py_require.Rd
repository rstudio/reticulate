\title{Declare Python Requirements}
\usage{
py_require(
  packages = NULL,
  python_version = NULL,
  ...,
  exclude_newer = NULL,
  action = c("add", "remove", "set")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{packages}{A character vector of Python packages to be available during
the session. These can be simple package names like \code{"jax"} or names with
version constraints like \code{"jax[cpu]>=0.5"}. Pip style syntax for installing
from local files or a git repository is also supported (see details).}

\item{python_version}{A character vector of Python version constraints \cr
(e.g., \code{"3.10"} or \code{">=3.9,<3.13"}).}

\item{...}{Reserved for future extensions; must be empty.}

\item{exclude_newer}{Limit package versions to those published before a
specified date. This offers a lightweight alternative to freezing package
versions, helping guard against Python package updates that break a
workflow. Accepts strings formatted as RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g.,
"2006-12-02T02:07:43Z") and local dates in the same format (e.g.,
"2006-12-02") in your system's configured time zone. Once \code{exclude_newer}
is set, only the \code{set} action can override it.}

\item{action}{Determines how \code{py_require()} processes the provided
requirements. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{add}: Adds the entries to the current set of requirements.
\item \code{remove}: Removes \emph{exact} matches from the requirements list. Requests to remove nonexistent entries are
ignored. For example, if \code{"numpy==2.2.2"} is in the list, passing \code{"numpy"}
with \code{action = "remove"} will not remove it.
\item \code{set}: Clears all existing requirements and replaces them with the
provided ones. Packages and the Python version can be set independently.
}}
}
\value{
\code{py_require()} is primarily called for its side effect of modifying
the manifest of "Python requirements" for the current R session  that
reticulate maintains internally. \code{py_require()} usually returns \code{NULL}
invisibly. If \code{py_require()} is called with no arguments, it returns the
current manifest--a list with names \code{packages}, \code{python_version}, and
\code{exclude_newer.} The list also has a class attribute, to provide a print
method.
}
\description{
\code{py_require()} allows you to declare Python requirements for the R session,
including Python packages, any version constraints on those packages, and any
version constraints on Python itself. Reticulate can then automatically
create and use an ephemeral Python environment that satisfies all these
requirements.
}
\details{
Reticulate will only use an ephemeral environment if no other Python
installation is found earlier in the \href{https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html#order-of-discovery}{Order of Discovery}.
You can also force reticulate to use an ephemeral environment by setting
\code{Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_USE_MANAGED_VENV="yes")}.

The ephemeral virtual environment is not created until the user interacts
with Python for the first time in the R session, typically when \code{import()} is
first called.

If \code{py_require()} is called with new requirements after reticulate has
already initialized an ephemeral Python environment, a new ephemeral
environment is activated on top of the existing one. Once Python is
initialized, only adding packages is supported---removing packages, changing
the Python version, or modifying \code{exclude_newer} is not possible.

Calling \code{py_require()} without arguments returns a list of the currently
declared requirements.

R packages can also call \code{py_require()} (e.g., in \code{.onLoad()} or elsewhere)
to declare Python dependencies. The print method for \code{py_require()} displays
the Python dependencies declared by R packages in the current session.
}
\note{
Reticulate uses \href{https://docs.astral.sh/uv/}{\code{uv}} to resolve Python
dependencies. Many \code{uv} options can be customized via environment variables,
as described \href{https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/}{here}.
For example:
\itemize{
\item If temporarily offline, set \code{Sys.setenv(UV_OFFLINE = "1")}.
\item To use a different index: \code{Sys.setenv(UV_INDEX = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu")}.
\item To allow resolving a prerelease dependency: \code{Sys.setenv(UV_PRERELEASE = "allow")}.

\subsection{Installing from alternate sources}{

The \code{packages} argument also supports declaring a dependency from a Git
repository or a local file. Below are some examples of valid \code{packages}
strings:

Install Ruff from a specific Git tag:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{  "git+https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff@v0.2.0"
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Install Ruff from a specific Git commit:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{  "git+https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff@1fadefa67b26508cc59cf38e6130bde2243c929d"
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Install Ruff from a specific Git branch:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{  "git+https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff@main"
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Install MarkItDown from the \code{main} branch---find the package in the
subdirectory 'packages/markitdown':

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{  "markitdown@git+https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown.git@main#subdirectory=packages/markitdown"
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Install MarkItDown from the local filesystem by providing an absolute path to
a directory containing a \code{pyproject.toml} or \code{setup.py} file:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{  "markitdown@/Users/tomasz/github/microsoft/markitdown/packages/markitdown/"
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

See more examples
\href{https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/packages/#installing-a-package}{here} and
\href{https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#examples}{here}.
}

\subsection{Clearing the Cache}{

If \code{uv} is already installed on your machine, \code{reticulate} will use the
existing \code{uv} installation as-is, including its default \verb{cache dir} location. To
clear the caches of a self-managed \code{uv} installation, send the following
system commands to \code{uv}:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{uv cache clean
rm -r "$(uv python dir)"
rm -r "$(uv tool dir)"
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

If \code{uv} is not installed, \code{reticulate} will automatically download
\code{uv} and store it along with ephemeral environments and all downloaded
artifacts in the \code{tools::R_user_dir("reticulate", "cache")} directory. To
clear this cache, simply delete the directory:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{unlink(tools::R_user_dir("reticulate", "cache"), recursive = TRUE)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
}
