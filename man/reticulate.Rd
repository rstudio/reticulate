\title{R Interface to Python}
\description{
R interface to Python modules, classes, and functions. When calling into
Python R data types are automatically converted to their equivalent Python
types. When values are returned from Python to R they are converted back to R
types. The reticulate package is compatible with all versions of Python >= 2.7.
Integration with NumPy requires NumPy version 1.6 or higher.
