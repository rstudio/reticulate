# reticulate (development version)

### Exceptions and Errors:

- R error information (call, message, other attributes) is now
  preserved as an R error condition traverses the R <-> Python boundary.

- Python Exceptions now inherit from `error` and `condition`, and can be
  passed directly to `base::stop()` to signal an error in R and raise an
  exception in Python.

- Raised Python Exceptions are now used directly to signal an R error.
  For example, in the following code, `e` is now an object that
  inherits from `python.builtin.Exception` as well as `error` and `condition`:
    ```r
    e <- tryCatch(py_func_that_raises_exception(),
                  error = function(e) e)
    ```
  Use `base::conditionCall()` and `base::conditionMessage()` to access
  the original R call and error message.

- `py_last_error()` return object contains `r_call`, `r_trace` and/or
  `r_class` if the Python Exception was raised by an R function called
  from Python.

- The hint to run `reticulate::py_last_error()` after an exception
  is now clickable in the RStudio IDE.

- Filepaths to Python files in the print output from `py_last_error()` are
  now clickable links in the RStudio IDE.

- Python exceptions encountered in `repl_python()` are now printed with the
  full Python traceback by default. In the RStudio IDE, filepaths in the tracebacks
  are rendered as clickable links. (#1240)

### Language:

- Converted Python callables gain support for dynamic dots from the rlang package.
  New features:
    - splicing (unpacking) arguments: `fn(!!!kwargs)`
    - dynamic names: `nm <- "key"; fn("{nm}" := value)`
    - trailing commas ignored (matching Python syntax): `fn(a, )` identical to `fn(a)`

- New Ops group generics for Python objects:
  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `%%`, `%/%`, `&`, `|`, `!`, `%*%`.
  Methods for all the Ops group generics are now defined for Python objects. (#1187, #1363)
  E.g., this now works:
  ```r
  np <- reticulate::import("numpy", convert = FALSE)
  x <- np$array(1:5)
  y <- np$array(6:10)
  x + y
  ```

- Fixed two issues with R comparison operator methods
  (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`):
   - The operators no longer error on Python objects that define "rich comparison"
     Python methods that don't return a single bool. (e.g., numpy arrays).
   - The operators now respect the 'convert' value of the supplied Python objects.
     Note, this may be a breaking change as, e.g, `==`, may now no long return
     an R scalar logical if one of the Python object being compared was created
     with `convert = FALSE`. Wrap the result of the comparison with `py_bool()` to
     restore the previous behavior.
  (#1187, #1363)

- R functions wrapping Python callables now have formals matching
  those of the Python callable signature, enabling better
  autocompletion in more contexts (#1361).

- new `nameOfClass()` S3 method for Python types, enabling usage:
  `base::inherits(x, <python-type-object>)` (requires R >= 4.3.0)

- `py_run_file()` and `source_python()` now prepend the script directory to
  the Python module search path, `sys.path`, while the requested script is executing.
  This allows the Python scripts to resolve imports of modules defined in the
  script directory, matching the behavior of `python <script>` at the command line.
  (#1347)

### knitr:

- The knitr engine now suppresses warnings from Python code if
  `warning=FALSE` is set in the chunk options. (quarto-dev/quarto#125, #1358)

- Fixed issue where reticulate's knitr engine would attach comments in a
  code chunk to the wrong code chunk (requires Python>=3.8) (#1223).

- The knitr Python engine now respects the `strip.white` option (#1273).

- Fixed issue where the knitr engine would show an additional plot from a chunk
  if the user called `matplotlib.pyplot.show()` (#1380, #1383)

- reticulate gains the ability to bind to micromamba Python installations
  (#1378, #1176, #1382, #1379, thanks to Zia Khan, @zia1138)

### Misc:

- `py_to_r()` now succeeds when converting subtypes of the built-in
  types (e.g. `list`, `dict`, `str`). (#1352, #1348, #1226, #1354, #1366)

- New `pillar::type_sum()` method now exported for Python objects. That ensures
  the full object class name is printing in R tracebacks and tibbles
  containing Python objects.

- `py_load_object()` gains a `convert` argument. If `convert = FALSE`,
  the returned Python object will not be converted to an R object.

- Fixed error `r_to_py()` with Pandas>=2.0 and R data.frames with a
  factor column containing levels with `NA`.

- `r_to_py()` now succeeds for many additional types of R objects.
  Objects that reticulate doesn't know how to convert are presented to
  the Python runtime as a pycapsule (an opaque pointer to the underlying
  R object). Previously this would error.
  This allows for R code to pass R objects that cannot be safely
  converted to Python through the Python runtime to other R code.
  (e.g, to an R function called by Python code). (#1304)

- Default Python version used by `install_miniconda()` and friends
  is now 3.9 (was 3.8).

# reticulate 1.28

- Fixed issue where `source_python()` (and likely many other entrypoints)
  would error if reticulate was built with Rcpp 1.0.10. Exception and
  error handling has been updated to accommodate usage of `R_ProtectUnwind()`.
  (#1328, #1329).

- Fixed issue where reticulate failed to discover Python 3.11 on Windows. (#1325)

- Fixed issue where reticulate would error by attempting to bind to
  a cygwin/msys2 installation of Python on Windows (#1325).

# reticulate 1.27

- `py_run_file()` now ensures the `__file__` dunder is visible to the
  executing python code. (#1283, #1284)

- Fixed errors with `install_miniconda()` and `conda_install()`,
  on Windows (#1286, #1287, conda/conda#11795, #1312, #1297),
  and on Linux and macOS (#1306, conda/conda#10431)

- Fixed error when activating a conda env from a UNC drive on Windows (#1303).

# reticulate 1.26

- Fixed issue where reticulate failed to bind to python2. (#1241, #1229)

- A warning is now issued when reticulate binds to python2 that python2
  support will be removed in an upcoming reticulate release.

- `py_id()` now returns a character string, instead of an R integer (#1216).

- Fixed an issue where `py_to_r()` would not convert elements of a
  dictionary (#1221).

- Fixed an issue where setting `RETICULATE_PYTHON` or `RETICULATE_PYTHON_FALLBACK`
  on Windows to the pyenv-win `python.bat` shim would result in an error (#1263).

- Fixed an issue where `datetime.datetime` objects with a `tzinfo` attribute
  was not getting converted to R correctly (#1266).

- Fixed an issue where pandas `pandas.Categorical(,ordered=True)` Series were
  not correctly converted to an R ordered factor (#1234).

- The `reticulate` Python engine no longer halts on error for Python chunks
  containing parse errors when the `error=TRUE` chunk option is set. (#583)

- `install_python()` now leverages brew for python build dependencies like
  openssl@1.1 if brew is already installed and on the PATH, substantially speeding up
  `install_python()` on macOS systems with brew configured.

- Fixed an issue where reticulate would fail to bind to a conda environment on macOS or linux
  if conda installed a non-POSIX compliant activation script into the conda environment. (#1255)

- Fixed an issue where the python knitr engine would error when printing to
  HTML a constructor of class instances with a `_repr_html_` or `to_html` method
  (e.g., `pandas.DataFrame`; #1249, #1250).

- Fixed an issue where the python knitr engine would error when printing a
  plotly figure to an HTML document in some (head-less) linux environments (#1250).

- Fixed an issue where `conda_install(pip=TRUE)` would install packages into
  a user Python library instead of the conda env if the environment variable
  `PIP_USER=true` was set. `py_install()`, `virtualenv_install()`, and
  `conda_install()` now always specify `--no-user` when invoking `pip install`. (#1209)

- Fixed issue where `py_last_error()` would return unconverted Python objects (#1233)

- The Knitr engine now supports printing Python objects with
  `_repr_markdown_` methods. (via quarto-dev/quarto-cli#1501)

- `sys.executable` on Windows now correctly reports the path to the Python executable
  instead of the launching R executable. (#1258)

- The `sys` module is no longer automatically imported in `__main__` by reticulate.

- Fixed an issue on Windows where reticulate would fail to find Python installations from pyenv installed via scoop.

- Fixed an issue where `configure_environment()` would error on Windows. (#1247)

- Updated docs for compatibility with HTML5 / R 4.2.

- Updated r_to_py.sparseMatrix() method for compatibility with Matrix 1.4-2.

# reticulate 1.25

- Fixed an issue where reticulate would fail if R was running embedded under rpy2.
  reticulate now ensures the Python GIL is acquired before calling into Python.
  (#1188, #1203)

- Fixed an issue where reticulate would fail to bind to an ArcGIS Pro conda environment
  (#1200, @philiporlando).

- Fixed an issue where reticulate would fail to bind to an Anaconda
  base environment on Windows.

- All commands that create, modify, or delete a Python environment now echo
  the system command about to be executed. Affected:
    virtualenv_{create,install,remove}
    conda_{create,clone,remove,install,update}
    py_install

- `install_python()` and `create_virtualenv()` gain the ability to automatically
  select the latest patch of a requested Python version.
  e.g.: `install_python("3.9:latest")`, `create_virtualenv("my-env", version = "3.9:latest")`

- `install_python()` `version` arg gains default value of `"3.9:latest"`.
  `install_python()` can now be called with no arguments.

- Fixed an issue where reticulate would fail to bind to a conda python
  if the user didn't have write permissions to the conda installation (#1156).

- Fixed an issue where reticulate would fail to bind to a conda python if
  spaces were present in the file path to the associated conda binary (#1154).

- `use_python(, required = TRUE)` now issues a warning if the request will be ignored (#1150).

- New function `py_repr()` (#1157)

- `print()` and related changes (#1148, #1157):
  - The default `print()` method for Python objects now invokes `py_repr()` instead of `str()`.
  - All Python objects gain a default `format()` method that invokes `py_str()`.
  - `py_str()` default method no longer strips the object memory address.
  - `print()` now returns the printed object invisibly, for composability with `%>%`.

- Exception handling changes (#1142, @t-kalinowski):
  - R error messages from Python exceptions are now truncated differently to satisfy `getOption("warning.length")`.
    A hint to call `reticulate::py_last_error()` is shown if the exception message was truncated.

  - Python buffers `sys.stderr` and `sys.stdout` are now flushed when Python exceptions are raised.

  -`py_last_error()`:
    * Return object is now an S3 object 'py_error', includes a default print method.
    * The python Exception object ('python.builtin.Exception') is available as an R attribute.
    * Gains the ability to restore a previous exception if provided in a call `py_last_error(previous_error)`

  - Python traceback objects gain a default `format()` S3 method.

- Fixed `py_to_r()` for scipy matrices when scipy >= 1.8.0, since sparse matrices
    are now deprecated.

- Fixed `r_to_py()` for small scipy matrices.

- New maintainer: Tomasz Kalinowski

# reticulate 1.24

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate` would fail to bind to the system version
  of Python on macOS if command line tools were installed, but Xcode was not.

# reticulate 1.23

- `use_condaenv()` gains the ability to accept an absolute path to a python
  binary for `envname`.

- All python objects gain a `length()` method, that returns either `py_len(x)`,
  or if that fails, `as.integer(py_bool(x))`.

- `conda_create()` default for `python_version` changed from
  `NULL` to `miniconda_python_version()` (presently, 3.8).

- New function `py_bool()`, for evaluating Python "truthiness" of an object.

- `reticulate` gains the function `py_list_packages()`, and can be used to
  list the Python modules available and installed in a particular Python
  environment. (#933)

- `reticulate` now supports conversion of Python [datatable](https://github.com/h2oai/datatable)
  objects. (#1081)

- `repl_python()` gains support for invoking select magic and system commands
  like `!ls` and `%cd <dir>`. See `?repl_python()` for details and examples.

- The development branch for `reticulate` has moved to the "main" branch.

- `reticulate` gains `reticulate::conda_update()`, for updating the
  version of `conda` in a particular `conda` installation.

- `reticulate` gains `reticulate::miniconda_uninstall()`, for uninstalling
  the reticulate-managed version of Miniconda. (#1077)

- `reticulate::use_python()` and friends now assume `required = TRUE` by
  default. For backwards compatibility, when `use_python()` is called
  as part of a package load hook, the default value will instead be `FALSE`.

- `reticulate` now provides support for Python environments managed by
  [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). For projects containing a
  `pyproject.toml` file, `reticulate` will attempt to find and use the virtual
  environment managed by Poetry for that project. (#1031)

- The default version of Python used for the `r-reticulate` Miniconda environment
  installed via `reticulate::install_miniconda()` has changed from 3.6 to 3.8.

- `reticulate::install_miniconda()` now prefers installing the latest
  arm64 builds of miniforge. See https://conda-forge.org/blog/posts/2020-10-29-macos-arm64/
  for more details.

- `reticulate::conda_create()` gains the `environment` argument, used when
  creating a new conda environment based on an exported environment definition
  (e.g. `environment.yml` or `environment.json`).

- `reticulate` gains the function, `conda_export()`, for exporting a conda
  environment definition as YAML. Environments are exported as via the
  `conda env export` command. (#779)

- `reticulate::find_conda()` will now locate miniforge Conda installations
  located within the default install locations.

- Fixed an issue that caused `reticulate::conda_install(pip = TRUE)`
  to fail on windows. (#1053, @t-kalinowski)


# reticulate 1.22

- Fixed a regression that caused `reticulate::conda_install(pip = TRUE)`
  to fail. (#1052)


# reticulate 1.21

- `use_condaenv("base")` can now be used to activate the base Anaconda
  environment.

- `reticulate` will now execute any hooks registered via
  `setHook("reticulate.onPyInit", <...>)` after Python has been initialized.
  This can be useful for packages that need to take some action after
  `reticulate` has initialized Python.

- Further refined interrupt handling.

- Fixed an issue where attempting to bind `reticulate` to `/usr/bin/python3`
  on macOS could fail if Xcode was not installed. (#1017)

- The `reticulate` Python REPL no longer exits when a top-level interrupt
  is sent (e.g. via Ctrl + C).

- The miniconda auto-installer now supports aarch64 Linux machines. (#1012)

- Fixed an issue where matplotlib plots were incorrectly overwritten when
  multiple Python chunks in the same R Markdown document included plot output.
  (#1010)

- `reticulate` can now use the version of Python configured in projects using
  [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/). If the project contains a
  `Pipfile` at the root directory (as understood by `here::here()`), then
  `reticulate` will invoke `pipenv --venv` to determine the path to the
  Python virtual environment associated with the project. Note that the
  `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable, as well as usages of
  `use_python(..., force = TRUE)`, will still take precedence. (#1006)

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate::py_run_string(..., local = TRUE)` failed
  to return the dictionary of defined Python objects in some cases.


# reticulate 1.20

- Fixed an issue causing tests to fail on CRAN's M1mac machine.


# reticulate 1.19

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate`'s interrupt handlers could cause issues
  with newer versions of Python.

- `reticulate` now better handles Pandas categorical variables containing
  `NA` values. (#942)

- `reticulate` now supports converting `pandas.NA` objects into R `NA` objects.
  (#950)

- `reticulate` now sets the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to UTF-8
  when running within RStudio. This should allow UTF-8 input and output to be
  handled more appropriately.

- `reticulate` gains the `install_python()` function, used to install different
  versions of Python via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  ([pyenv-windows](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) on Windows).

- Interrupt signals (e.g. those generated by `Ctrl + C`) are now better handled
  by `reticulate`. In particular, when `repl_python()` is active, `Ctrl + C`
  can be used to interrupt a pending Python computation.

- `virtualenv_create()` gains the `pip_version` and `setuptools_version`
  arguments, allowing users to control the versions of `pip` and `setuptools`
  used when initializing the virtual environment. The `extra` argument can
  also now be used to pass arbitrary command line arguments when necessary.

- `virtualenv_create()` gains the `module` argument, used to control whether
  `virtualenv` or `venv` is used to create the requested virtual environment.

- `py_to_r.datetime.datetime` no longer errs when `tzname` is `NULL`, and
  instead assumes the time is formatted for `UTC`. (#876)

- `reticulate` now supports the rendering of [plotly](https://plotly.com/)
  plots and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) charts in rendered
  R Markdown documents. (#711)

- `reticulate` now avoids invoking property methods when inferring the type
  for Python class members, for auto-completion systems. (#907)

- `reticulate` now attempts to set the `QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH`
  environment variable when initializing a Conda installation of Python,
  when that associated plugins directory exists. (#586)

- The `reticulate` Python engine now supports the `results = "hold"` knitr
  chunk option. When set, any generated outputs are "held" and then displayed
  after the associated chunk's source code. (#530)

- `conda_create()` gains the `python_version` argument, making it easier to
  request that Conda environments are created with a pre-specified version
  of Python. (#766)

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate::conda_install()` would attempt to
  re-install the default Python package, potentially upgrading or downgrading
  the version of Python used in an environment.

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate` invoked its `reticulate.initialized` hook
  too early.

- Fixed an issue where Python modules loaded on a separate thread could cause
  a crash. (#885)

- `conda_install()` now allows version specifications for the `python_version`
  argument; e.g. `conda_install(python_version = ">=3.6")`. (#880)

- Fixed an issue where `conda_install()` failed to pass along `forge` and
  `channel` in calls to `conda_create()`. (#878)

- Fixed an issue where Python's auto-loader hooks could fail when binding
  to a Python 2.7 installation.


# reticulate 1.18

- Fixed an issue where `python_config()` could throw an error when attempting
  to query information about a Python 2.6 installation.


# reticulate 1.17

- `reticulate` now checks for and disallows installation of Python packages
  during `R CMD check`.

- `reticulate` no longer injects the `r` helper object into the main
  module if another variable called `r` has already been defined.

- The function `py_help_handler()` has now been exported, to be used by
  front-ends and other tools which need to provide help for Python objects
  in different contexts. (#864)

- Fixed an issue where timezone information could be lost when converting
  Python datetime objects to R. (#829)

- Fixed an issue where numeric (rather than integer) dimensions could cause
  issues when converting SciPy sparse matrices to their R counterparts. (#844)

- Fixed an issue where R `data.frame`s with non-ASCII column names could not
  be converted to Pandas DataFrames. (#834)

- Fixed an issue where the `pip_ignore_installed` argument in `conda_install()`
  was silently being ignored.

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate::conda_install()` could re-install Python
  into an environment when not explicitly requested by the user.

- `reticulate` now sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when discovering Python. (#836)

- `reticulate` is now better at capturing Python logger streams (those that
  write to stdout or stderr) when `py_capture_output()` is set. (#825)

- `reticulate` no longer calls `utils::loadhistory()` after each REPL iteration.

- `reticulate` now better detects when Python modules are loaded.

- `reticulate::import_from_path()` now accepts the `delay_load` parameter,
  allowing modules which should be loaded from a pre-specified path
  to be lazy-loaded.

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate` load hooks (normally defined via
  `setHook("reticulate::<module>::load", ...)`) would segfault if those
  hooks attempted to load the hooked module.

- `reticulate` now attempts to resolve the conda binary used to create the
  associated Conda environment in calls to `py_install()`. This should fix use
  cases where Conda environments are placed outside of the Conda installation
  itself.

- `reticulate` now sets `PYTHONPATH` before loading Python, to ensure modules
  are looked up in the same locations where a regular Python interpreter would
  find them on load. This should fix issues where `reticulate` was unable to
  bind to a Python virtual environment in some cases.

- `reticulate::virtualenv_create()` gains the `packages` argument, allowing one
  to choose a set of packages to be installed (via `pip install`) after the
  virtual environment has been created.

- `reticulate::virtualenv_create()` gains the `system_site_packages` argument,
  allowing one to control whether the `--system-site-packages` flag is passed
  along when creating a new virtual environment. The default value can be
  customized via the `"reticulate.virtualenv.system_site_packages"` option and
  now defaults to `FALSE` when unset.

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate::configure_environment()` would fail
  when attempting to configure an Anaconda environment. (#794)

- `reticulate` now avoids presenting a Miniconda prompt for interactive
  sessions during R session initialization.

- Fixed unsafe usages of `Rprintf()` and `REprintf()`.

- `reticulate::py_install()` better respects the `method` argument, when
  `py_install()` is called without an explicit environment name. (#777)

- `reticulate:::pip_freeze()` now better handles `pip` direct references.
  (#775)

- Fixed an issue where output generated from `repl_python()` would
  be buffered until the whole submitted command had completed.
  (#739, @randy3k)

- `reticulate` now explicitly qualifies symbols used from TinyThread
  with `tthread::`, to avoid issues with symbol conflicts during
  compilation. (#773)

- `reticulate` will now prefer an existing Miniconda installation over
  a `conda` binary on the PATH, when looking for Conda. (#790)


# reticulate 1.16

- TinyThread now calls `Rf_error()` rather than `std::terminate()`
  when an internal error occurs.

- Conversion of Pandas DataFrames to R no longer emits deprecation
  warnings with pandas >= 0.25.0. (#762)

- `reticulate` now properly handles the version strings returned by beta
  versions of `pip`. (#757)

- `conda_create()` gains the `forge` and `channel` arguments,
  analogous to those already in `conda_install()`. (#752, @jtilly)


# reticulate 1.15

- `reticulate` now ensures SciPy `csr_matrix` objects are sorted before
  attempting to convert them to their R equivalent. (#738, @paulofelipe)

- Fixed an issue where calling `input()` from Python with no prompt
  would fail. (#728)

- Lines ending with a semi-colon are no longer auto-printed in the
  `reticulate` REPL. (#717, @jsfalk)

- `reticulate` now searches for Conda binaries in /opt/anaconda and
  /opt/miniconda. (#713)

- The `conda` executable used by `reticulate` can now be configured using an R
  option. Use `options(reticulate.conda_binary = <...>)` to force `reticulate`
  to use a particular `conda` executable.

- `reticulate::use_condaenv()` better handles cases where no
  matching environment could be found. (#687)

- `reticulate` gains the `py_ellipsis()` function, used to access
  the Python `Ellipsis` builtin. (#700, @skeydan)

- `reticulate::configure_environment()` now only allows environment
  configuration within interactive R sessions, and ensures that the
  version of Python that has been initialized by Python is indeed
  associated with a virtual environment or Conda environment.
  Use `reticulate::configure_environment(force = TRUE)` to force
  environment configuration within non-interactive R sessions.

- `reticulate` now automatically flushes output written to Python's
  stdout / stderr, as a top-level task added by `addTaskCallback()`.
  This behavior is controlled with the `options(reticulate.autoflush)`
  option. (#685)

- `reticulate::install_miniconda()` no longer attempts to modify the
  system PATH or registry when installing Miniconda. (#681)

- `reticulate::conda_install()` gains the `channel` argument, allowing
  custom Conda channels to be used when installing Python packages.
  (#443)

- `reticulate::configure_environment()` can now be used to configure a
  non-Miniconda Python environment. (#682; @skeydan)

- Fixed an issue where matplotlib plots would be included using absolute
  paths, which fails in non-standalone documents rendered to HTML. (#669)

- Fixed an issue where `reticulate` would attempt to flush a non-existent
  stdout / stderr stream. (#584)


# reticulate 1.14

- Fixed an issue where `rmarkdown::render()` could fail when including
  matplotlib plots when `knit_root_dir` is set. (#645)

- `reticulate` now scans for Conda installations within the ~/opt folder,
  as per the updated installers distributed for macOS. (#661)

- Python classes can now be defined directly from R using the `PyClass()`
  function. (#635; @dfalbel)

- reticulate is now compatible with Python 3.9. (#630, @skeydan)

- Pandas DataFrames with a large number of columns should now be converted to
  R data.frames more quickly. (#620, @skeydan)

- Python loggers are now better behaved in the Python chunks of R Markdown
  documents. (#386)

- reticulate will now attempt to bind to `python3` rather than `python`,
  when no other version of Python has been explicitly requested by
  e.g. `use_python()`.

- reticulate now provides R hooks for Python's `input()` and `raw_input()`
  functions. It should now be possible to read user input from Python scripts
  loaded by reticulate. (#610)

- `reticulate` now more consistently normalizes the paths reported by
  `py_config()`. (#609)

- `reticulate` now provides a mechanism for allowing client packages to declare
  their Python package dependencies. Packages should declare the Python packages
  they require as part of the `Config/reticulate` field in their `DESCRIPTION` file.
  Currently, this only activated when using Miniconda; as the assumption is that
  users will otherwise prefer to manually manage their Python environments.
  Please see `vignette("python_dependencies")` for more details.

- `reticulate` will now prompt the user to create and use a
  [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment
  when no other suitable Python environment has already been requested. This
  should help ease some of the trouble in setting up a Python environment on
  different platforms. The installer code was contributed by @hafen, from the
  [rminiconda](https://github.com/hafen/rminiconda) package.

  fail when `convert = TRUE` is set on the associated Python object.
  (#554)

- Fixed an issue where the wrong definition of `[[.python.builtin.object`
  was being exported. (#554)

- `py_install()` now accepts `python_version`, and can be used
  if a particular version of Python is required for a Conda
  environment. (This argument is ignored for virtual environments.)
  (#549)

- Fixed an issue where reticulate could segfault in some cases
  (e.g. when using the `iterate()` function). (#551)

- It is now possible to compile `reticulate` with support for debug
  versions of Python by setting the `RETICULATE_PYTHON_DEBUG` preprocessor
  define during compilation. (#548)

- reticulate now warns if it did not honor the user's request to load a
  particular version of Python, as through e.g. `reticulate::use_python()`.
  (#545)

- `py_save_object()` and `py_load_object()` now accept `...` arguments. (#542)

- `py_install()` has been revamped, and now better detects

- reticulate now flushes stdout / stderr after calls to `py_run_file()` and
  `py_run_string()`.

  environments created by the Python `venv` module.

- Reticulate better handles conversions of R lists to Python, and similarly,
  Python lists to R. We now call `r_to_py()` on each sub-element of an R list,
  and similarly, `py_to_r()` on each sub-element of a Python list.

- Reticulate now always converts R `Date` objects into Python `datetime`
  objects. Note that these conversions can be inefficient -- if you would
  prefer conversion to NumPy `datetime64` objects / arrays, you should convert
  your date to `POSIXct` first.

- Python chunks containing errors will cause execution to halt if 'error=FALSE'
  during render, conforming with the default knitr behavior for R chunks.
