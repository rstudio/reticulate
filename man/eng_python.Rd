\title{A reticulate Engine for Knitr}
\usage{
eng_python(options)
}
\arguments{
\item{options}{Chunk options, as provided by \code{knitr} during chunk execution.}
}
\description{
This provides a \code{reticulate} engine for \code{knitr}, suitable for usage when
attempting to render Python chunks. Using this engine allows for shared state
between Python chunks in a document -- that is, variables defined by one
Python chunk can be used by later Python chunks.
}
\details{
The engine can be activated by setting (for example)

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{knitr::knit_engines$set(python = reticulate::eng_python)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Typically, this will be set within a document's setup chunk, or by the
environment requesting that Python chunks be processed by this engine.
Note that \code{knitr} (since version 1.18) will use the \code{reticulate} engine by
default when executing Python chunks within an R Markdown document.
